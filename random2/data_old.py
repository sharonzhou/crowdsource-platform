        "snippet": "After earning his first doctorate, Oppenheim entered academia. He immediately took up a lectureship at Edinburgh University in Scotland and then to the surprise of many, he left for Raffles College in Malaysia. According to The Independent, Oppenheim, who was always sensitive about ill-informed criticism of institutions of higher learning in the developing world, was infuriated when a prominent professor pompously opined that it was only the granting of full university status that allowed research of any significance. In response, Oppenheim decided to draw the attention of the University of Oxford to the mathematical work that he had completed while at Raffles. He not only made his point but his research and contributions were so significant, he was promptly awarded a second doctorate, a D.Sc., in Science, despite the fact he was not an enrolled student in the D.Sc. program. Oppenheim helped transform the tiny unknown Raffles College into the National University of Singapore, now one of the top research universities in the world. During WWII, Oppenheim who was captured by the Japanese and held as a POW, fled Singapore for a short time to pursue. He pursued research in Switzerland at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and at Einstein's alma mater, the ETH. Oppenheim had a number of interests, including horticulture, growing and raising his own roses, politics, board-games, card-games and intellectual walks. Oppenheim married his first wife Beatrice in 1930, at age 27, with whom he had one child. They had met at the University of Chicago. Oppenheim's wife's sister, Allegra, was also a graduate student at the University of Chicago, earning her Master's Degree in Education. After 47 years of marriage, Oppenheim divorced his first wife in 1977. Oppenheim remarried in 1982 at the age of 79 and had two sons with his second wife. Oppenheim died of natural causes in 1997, at the age of 94. Oppenheim is survived by his second wife, three children, and several nephews and nieces. To the end of his life, he read widely and remained capable of the most perceptive, pithy and amusing commentary on the problems both of old age and of the wider world."

Shrake started on the police beat for the underdog Press while Gary Cartwright covered the same beat for the mainstream Fort Worth Star-Telegram. According to Cartwright, he and Shrake usually could be found hanging out at a bar across the street from the police station; a copy boy monitoring police calls would alert them to stories. Looking back at his job interview at the Press, Shrake would write ``it was a rackety, dirty city paper, with the teletypes clacking and a sense of urgency everywhere. A copy editor was eating tuna fish out of a can, and the bowling writer was drinking bourbon, and I thought, 'This is the world I want to be in.' `` At the Press, he also worked under legendary sports editor Blackie Sherrod who said about Shrake, ``he immediately showed talent and went on to remarkable success and acclaim far beyond the pressbox.``"

He was awarded a Bachelor of Arts Degree with Honours in 2000 for Visual Communication. Shortly after, he went on to become a qualified Art teacher gaining a Post Graduate Certificate in Education from Huddersfield University. His first solo exhibition entitled ''A Walk On the Darkside``, boasted forty five pieces of his original artwork including demonic statues, biomechanical monsters and giant canvas`` depicting images of horror and the macabre. The exhibition was featured in various National newspapers including The Daily Telegraph as well as BBC Radio ONE and live interviews on BBC Radio Leeds North - resulting in the show being extended to six weeks due to popular demand. The show had its own share of disapproval also in the form of protest and boycott attempts due to the nature and subject matter of his work involving the 'murder' and disembowelment of children's toys as well as the use of real animal bones mixed with various parts of machinery."
